# <small> Short Academic Bio </small>
<img style="float: right; width:200px" src="./../img/portrait.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="20">
I am a DPhil student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, working with Chris Yau and Chris Holmes. I am developing probabilistic models and scalable algorithms for the analysis of large-scale datasets with a particular focus on genomics data.

A few other areas of interest are deep generative models, machine learning applications in healthcare, distributed computing and community detection in networks.

I received a Bachelos and Masters degree in Physics from Humboldt University Berlin. I undertook research and most coursework for my masters at the University of British Columbia where I worked on tracer kinetic models for the analysis of time-resolved magentic resonance
